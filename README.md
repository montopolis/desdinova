## Future ideas

- easier color palettes

## First Steps (deployed publicly in 10 minutes!)

1. Copy this repo into a folder (no other install needed)
1. Initialize as a git repo on Github or Gitlab (Bitbucket is not supported by Cloudflare Pages)
2. run `npm install`
1. Update `astro.config.mjs`

- update SITE_* variables
- update `site:`

2. Update Logo
2. Update Favicon
2. Update Font (if necessary)
2. Update Colors (if necessary)
3. run `npm run dev` to test site locally
3. When finished commit all and push to Git
3. Setup Cloudflare Pages
4. Fin!

## Second Steps

1. Customize Top Menu in `TopMenu.astro`
2. Customize Bottom Menu in `BottomMenu.astro`
3. Add any needed scripts to `Analytics.astro`
4. Update `index.astro` - this is your home page
5. Ideally `/src/components/_core` will remain untouched to make future updates easier

## Adding a new page (aka A Basic Flowbite Workflow)

1. Copy `_starterPage.astro` to a new file
1. Update `pageTitle` and `pageDescription` in `<Layout pageTitle="_starter" pageDescription="_starter Page">`
1. Find a component or block on https://flowbite.com that you want to use
1. Click "Copy Code" (you do not need the CSS)
1. Paste inside `<Layout></Layout>`
1. Customize
1. Review, Edit, and Repeat until happy
1. Add page to the Top or Bottom Menu, or as a hyperlink somewhere else on the site

## Setup Cloudflare Pages for your Domain

2. Go to Workers & Pages
3. Click on your Site

5. Click "Setup a custom domain"
6. Type in the name of your website (ex. www.mywebsite.com or mywebsite.com)

9. Wait 5-60 minutes for Cloudflare do its DNS & SSL magic
10. Fin!
11. NOTE: If you want to support non-www and www access to the same domain it might be best to setup a custom Cloudflare
    Redirect Rule (https://community.cloudflare.com/t/redirect-the-www-to-non-www/558655)

## Update Logo

- replace `/src/images/logo-square.png` with your square logo
- replace `/src/images/logo.png` with your logo

## Update Favicon

### Modern Way to implement Favicon ðŸ¤©

https://realfavicongenerator.net/svg-favicon/

- update `favicon.svg` and `favicon.png` in `/public`
- NOTE: `Head.astro` contains Favicon code

## Update Font

### method #1 via fontsource with font bundled into site

- add font to `package.json` from https://fontsource.org
- import font in `Head.astro`

### method #2 via google fonts (recommend enabling Cloudflare Fonts)

- add font in `Head.astro`

### all methods

- update font in `Layout.astro` in CSS styles at the bottom of the file
- update font in `tailwind.config.mjs`

## Update Colors

- ...

## Updating Astro

- Stash any pending git updates so you have a clean slate
- run `npx @astrojs/upgrade` to upgrade astro 1st party packages
- be aware of breaking changes or live dangerously and try it anyway!
- you can now optionally run `npm run update` to update non-astro packages
- run `npm run astro check` to make sure no errors
- test site using `npm run preview`
- if all works, commit and push!
- I'll do my best to keep Desdinova up to date with upstream updates

## How to port Desdinova updates to your site

- this is tricky ðŸ˜¬
- if your site is working and building properly, don't worry about it ðŸ˜…

### Update approaches:

1. (easy) if you have limited your updates to only the `/src/pages` folder you can copy everything else over, re-run
   `npm install` and validate
1. (tricky) apply individual updates from Desdinova repo into yours as needed
1. (reboot option) pull down a new copy of Desdinova and refactor your old site into it (this is probably what I will be
   doing once a year for my sites)
1. more than likely I'll just Update Astro (using method included in README), Tailwind and Flowbite, and third party
   packages as needed

## Images

- images put in `src/assets/images` will be optimized by Astro if they are imported
- https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images
- otherwise put images in `/public`

## Scripts (ex. Analytics, etc.)

- put any scripts you need in `Analytics.astro`

## STAGING/PRODUCTION environments support

If you create a `BUILD_MODE` .ENV variable on Cloudflare Pages or locally you can conditionally render code/scripts as
required.

This allows you to conditionally include scripts or HTML as needed per Environment.

```javascript
{
    import.meta.env.BUILD_MODE === "production" && (
        <script>// add scripts here for production only</script>
    )
}
```

```javascript
{
    import.meta.env.BUILD_MODE === "production" && (
        <b>Or put HTML code which only renders for production</b>
    )
}

```

## Desdinova?!?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_(song)

One of my all-time favorite Blue Ã–yster Cult songs!

When I was in middle school the original studio and live versions were in constant rotation either on vinyl or cassette
tape. I was lucky to see them many times in high school.

I was 17 when the 1988 version dropped on the album Imaginos, which is a SPECTACULAR redo of the song, along with the
entire album. Imaginos is still in rotation for me.

```text
Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
```
