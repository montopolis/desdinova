## Updating the Logo

-   Replace `src/assets/images/logo-square.png` with your square logo
-   Replace `src/assets/images/logo.png` with your primary logo
-   For further customization, edit `src/components/SiteLogo.astro`

## Updating the Favicon

### Modern Way to Implement Favicon

Use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/svg-favicon/)

-   Update `favicon.svg` and `favicon.png` in the `/public` folder
-   Note: Nothing else necessary for most browsers. Further customizations can be made in `src/components/Favicon.astro`

## Updating the Font

### Method #1: Bundled via Fontsource (recommended)

-   Add the font to `package.json` from [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org)
-   Import the font in `src/components/Fonts.astro`

### Method #2: Google Fonts (not recommended, but if you do enable Cloudflare Fonts)

-   Include the font in `src/components/Font.astro`

### For All Methods

-   Modify the font settings in `tailwind.config.mjs`

## Updating Colors

-   You can update the `primary` color palette in `tailwind.config.mjs`
-   You can get color palettes from https://uicolors.app/
-   You can also get color palettes from https://flowbite.com/blocks/marketing/header/#default-header-navigation

## Updating Astro

-   Stash any pending git updates to start with a clean slate
-   Run `npx @astrojs/upgrade` to upgrade Astro's first-party packages
-   Be mindful of potential breaking changes or proceed at your own risk
-   Optionally, run `npm run update` to update non-Astro packages
-   Ensure there are no errors with `npm run astro check`
-   Test the site using `npm run preview`
-   If everything is functional, commit and push the changes
-   Desdinova will be kept up-to-date with upstream updates as best as possible

## Porting Desdinova Updates to Your Site

-   This can be complex üò¨
-   If your site is functional and building correctly, it's often best to leave it as is üòÖ

### Update Approaches

1. **Easy:** If your changes are limited to the `src/pages` folder, copy over other content, re-run `npm install`, and
   validate
2. **Tricky:** Apply specific updates from the Desdinova repository to your site as needed
3. **Full Reboot:** Set up a new Desdinova instance and refactor your existing site into it (this is my annual practice
   for my sites)
4. **Most Likely:** I'll update Astro, Tailwind, Flowbite, and third-party packages as necessary
   using [this approach](#updating-astro)

## Image Handling

-   Images placed in `src/assets/images` will be optimized by Astro if imported
-   Refer to [Astro Image Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images)
-   Alternatively, store images in the `/public` directory

## Announcement Banner

-   Customize the banner in `src/components/Announcement.astro`
-   To disable the banner, comment out `<Announcement />` in `src/pages/index.astro`

## Change Blog Posts Sort Order

-   see notes in `src/scripts/_desdinova-scripts.ts`

## Draft Blog Posts

Blog posts that are marked `draft=true` are not published to Production. Just add `draft=true` to the frontmatter/metadata at the top of the blog post.

## Scripts (e.g., Analytics)

-   Place required scripts in `src/components/Analytics.astro`

## Configuring Redirects

-   You can specify a mapping of permanent redirects in your Astro config with the redirects value. For most redirects, this is a mapping of an old route to the new route:
-   https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#configured-redirects

## Environment Support (Local/Staging/Production)

Set up a `BUILD_MODE` environment variable in Cloudflare Pages or locally (copy `.env.example` to `.env`) to
conditionally render code or scripts based on the environment.

This allows specific scripts or HTML to be included as needed per environment.

```javascript
{
    import.meta.env.BUILD_MODE === "production" && (
        <script>// add scripts here for production only</script>
    )
}
```

```javascript
{
    import.meta.env.BUILD_MODE === "production" && (
        <b>Or put HTML code which only renders for production</b>
    )
}
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables in Cloudflare Pages

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages site
2. Click "Settings"
3. Select "Add variables" or "Edit Variables"
4. Add the variable "BUILD_MODE"
5. Set the value as needed
6. Done!

## Desdinova (üó£Ô∏è des-de-nova)

Inspired by one of my favorite Blue √ñyster Cult songs!

When I was in middle school, the original studio and live versions were frequently playing either on vinyl or cassette
tape. I was fortunate to attend several of their concerts during high school.

At 17, the 1988 re-release on the Imaginos album wowed me; it's a spectacular redo, and the entire album remains in
rotation for me.

```text
Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
```
