<a id="update-logo"></a>

## Updating the Logo

- Replace `/src/images/logo-square.png` with your square logo
- Replace `/src/images/logo.png` with your primary logo
- For further customization, edit `/src/components/SiteLogo.astro`

<a id="update-favicon"></a>

## Updating the Favicon

### Modern Way to Implement Favicon

Use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/svg-favicon/)

- Update `favicon.svg` and `favicon.png` in the `/public` folder
- Note: Favicon settings are in `/src/components/_core/Head.astro`

<a id="update-font"></a>

## Updating the Font

### Method #1: Bundled via Fontsource

- Add the font to `package.json` from [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org)
- Import the font in `/src/components/_core/Head.astro`

### Method #2: Google Fonts (Enable Cloudflare Fonts recommended)

- Include the font in `/src/components/_core/Head.astro`

### Updating All Methods

- Update the CSS styles at the bottom of `/src/Layout/Layout.astro`
- Modify the font settings in `tailwind.config.mjs`

<a id="update-colors"></a>

## Updating Astro

- Stash any pending git updates to start with a clean slate
- Run `npx @astrojs/upgrade` to upgrade Astro's first-party packages
- Be mindful of potential breaking changes or proceed at your own risk
- Optionally, run `npm run update` to update non-Astro packages
- Ensure there are no errors with `npm run astro check`
- Test the site using `npm run preview`
- If everything is functional, commit and push the changes
- Desdinova will be kept up-to-date with upstream updates as best as possible

## Porting Desdinova Updates to Your Site

- This can be complex ðŸ˜¬
- If your site is functional and building correctly, it's often best to leave it as is ðŸ˜…

### Update Approaches

1. **Easy:** If your changes are limited to the `/src/pages` folder, copy over other content, re-run `npm install`, and
   validate
2. **Tricky:** Apply specific updates from the Desdinova repository to your site as needed
3. **Full Reboot:** Set up a new Desdinova instance and refactor your existing site into it (this is my annual practice
   for my sites)
4. Likely, I'll update Astro, Tailwind, Flowbite, and third-party packages as necessary using the methods described in
   the README

## Image Handling

- Images placed in `/src/assets/images` will be optimized by Astro if imported
- Refer to [Astro Image Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images)
- Alternatively, store images in the `/public` directory

## Announcement Banner

- Customize the banner in `/src/components/Announcement.astro`
- To disable the banner, comment out `<Announcement />` in `/src/pages/index.astro`

## Scripts (e.g., Analytics)

- Place required scripts in `/src/components/Analytics.astro`

## Environment Support (Local/Staging/Production)

Set up a `BUILD_MODE` environment variable in Cloudflare Pages or locally (copy `.env.example` to `.env`) to
conditionally render code or scripts based on the environment.

This allows specific scripts or HTML to be included as needed per environment.

```javascript
{
    import.meta.env.BUILD_MODE === "production" && (
        <script>// add scripts here for production only</script>
    )
}
```

```javascript
{
    import.meta.env.BUILD_MODE === "production" && (
        <b>Or put HTML code which only renders for production</b>
    )
}
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables in Cloudflare Pages

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages site
2. Click "Settings"
3. Select "Add variables" or "Edit Variables"
4. Add the variable "BUILD_MODE"
5. Set the value as needed
6. Done!

## Desdinova

Inspired by one of my favorite Blue Ã–yster Cult songs!

When I was in middle school, the original studio and live versions were frequently playing either on vinyl or cassette
tape. I was fortunate to attend several of their concerts during high school.

At 17, the 1988 re-release on the Imaginos album wowed me; it's a spectacular redo, and the entire album remains in
rotation for me.

```text
Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
```
