## Headings: The Royalty of Text

### Lord Heading the First

Behold, the grand headings that rule over the lands of text! Bow before **Lord Heading the First** and his kingdom.

#### Sir Subheading the Brave

And here is **Sir Subheading the Brave**, fighting the good fight against the forces of plaintext.

## Paragraphs: A Textual Playground

Ah, paragraphs. The sandboxes of the textual world. Here, words play together in **sandbox paradise**.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa! Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

## Emphasis: Italics and Boldness

*Italicize your way out of awkward situations.*
**Boldly go where no text has gone before!**
_And if you're feeling extra fancy, **combine** them!_

## Blockquotes: Because Quoting is Cool

> "To be or not to be, that is the question." - Shakespeare

> "I came, I saw, I made a list." - Caesar, probably

## Lists: The Bullet Points of Destiny

### Unordered Lists

- Cats
- Pizza
  - Pepperoni
  - Extra cheese
- Dogs who think they're cats

### Ordered Lists

1. Wake up
2. Realize it's Monday
   1. Mourn the weekend
   2. Consider calling in sick
3. Drag yourself out of bed

## Code: Nerds Unite!

Inline `code` is like carrying a tiny, magical sword that can slay bugs.

```python
# And behold, the magical code block!
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greet("World"))
```
